### Late-teens: Poetry from 17 to 19
***
### <div align="center">Prologue</div>

Hello,

It’s weird now. I find myself grieving my past and fearing my future. For so long</div> I’ve been held together by a thread that I pulled tight- so tight that I think it has snapped and I’m beginning to come undone. But picking myself back up has been a seminal experience, and what seems to define the general vibe of “your 20’s”. Below is a collection of poetry, I call it “Late-teens”. It started when I was 17 and I was feeling too much emotion that I had too little ways of expressing. I always had outlets like theater, soccer, work, etc.; but a second year into some little pandemic you may have heard of made all of those outlets inaccessible. I wrote something down in my notes, and sent it to two of my friends… they really liked it. Their genuine appreciation made me feel something I haven’t in so long, something that was so desperately missing from the fabric of my body. I decided that I would continue to write down these poems until my next birthday and collect them into one body of work, aptly titled “17”. However, i soon realized that 18 didn’t feel far different from 17… you’re still a “teen” after all. So I decided to continue writing these poems and combine “18” with “17”- and then “19”. I had three years of work in my hands. A written record of my emotional state through some of the most transformative times I went through. I wrote about everything from romance and fear and deep sadness, politics and the earth and subjects i liked (but mostly romance hehe). I knew what I wanted to do with all of this: put it somewhere on the internet, free so I can share my work with people who might also like it as much as I do. On my twentieth birthday, I decided that I would upload it online for all to see. That was almost a year ago (life has a funny way of not moving forward sometimes). Now here I am, approaching the anniversary of my stagnation- finally feeling the fire under my ass to do the thing I kept telling myself I had to get to over and over and over, and over, again. So here it is: “Late-teens”. While the poems have been compiled into three sections by my age, i have also preserved the order I wrote them in and have not made any future edits; what you see below is how I intended it to exist when I was 17, 18, 19. Perhaps you can see a sort of… progress in all of it. Enjoy my little pop culture and history references mixed in with existential yearning and lust, and other ramblings.

Thank you (with love),

RA

P.S. If you cringe at something I wrote, just know that I probably cringed too rereading it  years later. But cringe culture is lowkey dead anyway…

#### <div align="center">“Cool, I Guess”</div>

<div align="center">If I was your sexual awakening</div>
<div align="center">Then why didn’t you fucking say something</div>
<div align="center">Do you know how many nights I’ve laid in bed</div>
<div align="center">Wishing I was with you instead</div>
<div align="center">Not even you, but just someone else</div>
<div align="center">And this will probably be the twelfth-</div>
<div align="center">Time that I have to sit and hear</div>
<div align="center">That someone had a thing for me freshmen year</div>
<div align="center">Or sophmore or even junior year too</div>
<div align="center">I was hoping the cycle could end with you</div>
<div align="center">But now you’re off with some other face</div>
<div align="center">So why did you even tell me in the first place</div>
<div align="center">This isn't Monopoly, it’s the game of my life</div>
<div align="center">So please stop exploiting my worst vice</div>
<div align="center">You’re welcome for your self reflection</div>
<div align="center">But I still want my sensual pension</div>
<div align="center">And I’m not talking about our sexual tension</div>
<div align="center">And don’t get me started on your eye’s erection</div>
<div align="center">Because before I was your sexual awakening</div>
<div align="center">So why did you decide now, to say something</div>
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;

#### <div align="center">“Book Burnings”</div>

<div align="center">The sun rises and turns pages of books</div>
<div align="center">Some books never close- in midnight they thrive</div>
<div align="center">The hero of mine thinks, but never looks</div>
<div align="center">Throughout the day our stories will revive</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Many books have burned over the decades</div>
<div align="center">Like beloved grandma from chapter 16</div>
<div align="center">Shadows of doubt put my book in the shade</div>
<div align="center">The pages are stained an envious green</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Shortcomings of lots, my book I will burn</div>
<div align="center">The pursuit of reading has hurt too much</div>
<div align="center">But, since my future I have yet to learn</div>
<div align="center">I’ll wait some more chapters before fire’s touch</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Perhaps I will prolong my book’s ill fate</div>
<div align="center">Beside’s, an incinerator awaits</div>
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;

 #### <div align="center">“Am I Alive”</div>

<div align="center">Am I still Alive</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">If you’re reading this haiku</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Then I am alive</div>
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;

#### <div align="center">“Find X”</div>

<div align="center">I know you are buried somewhere in there</div>
<div align="center">Thanks to your father and mother and friends</div>
<div align="center">The smart boy with the most delightful stare</div>
<div align="center">Seems to be at masculinity’s end</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Your actions and words have left it tainted</div>
<div align="center">My precious memory of our shared youth</div>
<div align="center">Your action’s brash and your words exclaimed</div>
<div align="center">After months i was forced to see the truth</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">I thought our bodies were tuned the same pitch</div>
<div align="center">But the time apart has clouded our song</div>
<div align="center">And now you’re somewhat of an obtuse bitch</div>
<div align="center">So maybe I arranged the music wrong</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Now you’re in the equation once again</div>
<div align="center">But I’m not the one who will pull you out</div>
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;

#### <div align="center">“Am I Your Honey”</div>

<div align="center">Just a pot of honey, I stood alone</div>
<div align="center">Hibernating season has thinned the crowd</div>
<div align="center">They’ve admired my outsides, beauty lone</div>
<div align="center">But you know my sweetness, you make me proud</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">The bear, my predatory protector</div>
<div align="center">What I’d do to be under your control</div>
<div align="center">I’ve found subtle soft spots from your banter</div>
<div align="center">Not many bears I’d let into my bowl</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Why can’t you savor my saccharine lips</div>
<div align="center">Why can’t you grasp on my ceramic hips</div>
<div align="center">Please, why can’t you please come back from your trip</div>
<div align="center">Into my longed restless rest we can slip</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Yet while you are off in some other woods</div>
<div align="center">This honey pot will wait, as best he could</div>
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;

#### <div align="center">“Why Don’t You Know That You’re In Love With Me”</div>

<div align="center">Why don’t you know that you’re in love with me</div>
<div align="center">Maybe it’s just me but me knows what’s best</div>
<div align="center">They always get impulsive around me</div>
<div align="center">Trying to win my attention’s contest</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">Why do I always get texts when you’re drunk</div>
<div align="center">Why do you need to put your hands on me</div>
<div align="center">Why do you admire, praise me with spunk</div>
<div align="center">Why do you act like, your glares, I can’t see</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">They come in all kinds, some young and some old</div>
<div align="center">And back to their girlfriends like I’m their vice</div>
<div align="center">The bold one’s never want to be told cold</div>
<div align="center">The chilling truth, reality’s advice</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">I see you looking at me from above</div>
<div align="center">Tell me I’m delusional, _you’re in love_</div>
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;

#### <div align="center">“I Thought You’d Hate Him”</div>

<div align="center">I’ll cut the bullshit, you embarrass me</div>
<div align="center">I’d say it’s not your fault, but it sure is</div>
<div align="center">Sure as the way i feel when we walk, see</div>
<div align="center">Dichotomy down the halls, what is this</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">I should hate you, I should want you far gone</div>
<div align="center">That’s what they tell me, what I told my brain</div>
<div align="center">Then my distaste for you grew on and on</div>
<div align="center">But there’s passion in hate, love can be vain</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">You’re ignorant, ugly, dumb, immature</div>
<div align="center">I’m disingenuous with what I say</div>
<div align="center">You’re cute, nostalgic, relatable, pure</div>
<div align="center">You’re the bad, but at the end of the day</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">The more I don’t want to be seen with you</div>
<div align="center">The more I can’t stand being without you</div>
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;

#### <div align="center">“All The Records I Could Afford”</div>

<div align="center">I walked to my car alone at night</div>
<div align="center">A bottle in one hand, the other holds spite</div>
<div align="center">I feel him behind me, I hear his cold chill</div>
<div align="center">Finally the Reaper has my hopes to fulfill</div>
<div align="center">Yet something impedes his due completion</div>
<div align="center">He’s too scared to finalize my deletion</div>
<div align="center">Break the glass over Death’s head</div>
<div align="center">He was useless, I’ll do it instead</div>
<div align="center">Slit my wrists with the shards of glass</div>
<div align="center">The moonlight refracts the moments passed</div>
<div align="center">The blood twists down around my arm, coiled</div>
<div align="center">Like a snake; the blood rushes up, boiled</div>
<div align="center">“How did we get here” that is the question</div>
<div align="center">I couldn’t even tell you my intentions</div>
<div align="center">Maybe it was the nights I didn’t sleep</div>
<div align="center">Maybe it was all the times I didn’t weep</div>
<div align="center">Maybe it was all my heart I invested</div>
<div align="center">Maybe it was my brain, constantly congested</div>
<div align="center">I could point at friends, “enemies”, and guys</div>
<div align="center">To be consistent is to keep spinning these lies</div>
<div align="center">Lies that aren’t mine, for the record</div>
<div align="center">For all the records I could afford</div>
<div align="center">I’d take a trip to the record store</div>
<div align="center">Stored in the back is my true amour </div>
<div align="center">But now I’ll never meet that amour</div>
<div align="center">Because for the record, even suicide is a bore</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">After recording this, my records yearn for more</div>
<div align="center">If I die now, _what would all of this have been for?_</div>
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;

#### <div align="center">“I Don’t Know”</div>

<div align="center">Do I write for my-</div>
<div align="center">Self or am I afraid of</div>
<div align="center">Being forgotten</div>
